# AutomataToolbox
Final project for Theory of Computation


Feature List
NFA simulation
  Simplifies NFA for some lambda cycles
NFA tools:
  Concat
  Or
  Star
  Deep copy
  some internal functions
DFA simulation
  DFA is an NFA with an additional validator
  removes lambda moves
DFA Tools
  nfa -> dfa
  minimize a dfa
Regex to NFA
  Or, concat, and star accepted :)
  parentheses obviously (and annoyingly)
